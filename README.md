## Description
  A simple command-line application that is able to view and manage a MySQL database for optimal organization, built using Node.js. The application uses the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) node package to connect to our MySQL database and perform SQL queries from within the app. The user interface was made with [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) while our database rows are displayed on screen via the [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) package.
